# FoundU

FoundU is a platform for the curious. An app which enables you to search for likeminded people for a coffee, a park chat or anything, really. 

The idea behind FoundU is to connect people who are physically close (in the same city or area) and share a common interest. You love Gloohaven but none of your friends play it? Are you interested in the intersection between Deep Learning and Neuroscience but do not know any knowledgeable people? Try FoundU.
