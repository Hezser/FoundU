        let question5 = "That'll get you attention! Here, by searching and adding tags you can tell me about your interests, hobbies, etc. You'll soon get more familiar wth tags and start adding more, but it's best to have some already."

        let question7 = "What about your working life? You can tell me a maximum of three places you've worked at. This is also an optional one."
